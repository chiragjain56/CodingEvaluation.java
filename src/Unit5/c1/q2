Q2.What is the 3NF? Explain with an example. You donâ€™t need to draw the
   tables or write the queries. Just mention the schema before and after the
   third normal form.

Ans: 3nf contains any transitive partial dependency. it is used to reduce data . for 3nf data must be in 2nf.
there is no transitive dependency for non-prime attributes.

eg: if an employee table have all the attribute(emp_id,emp_name,emp_city,emp_state,emp_zip)
then candidate key is emp_id;
and all attribute except emp_id are non_prime.
here emp state and emp city depend on emp zip which is depend on emp_id.so we can clearly see that (emp_state,emp_city)
dependent on super key emp_id.it violets the rule so we divide it into two tables;

a-->b-->c
where 1st table contains
empid,empname,empzip  //a-->b

2nd table contains
empzip,empstate,empcity  //b-->c
